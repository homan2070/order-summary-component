## Acknowledgments

This is my first attempt in designing all by my own and from scratch. I searched in internet for every single thing which I didn't know how to do. 
My aim was designing it with all I know now. At first it seemed impossible to do but I am very happy that I didn't give up and I proud my self even though it is not perfect.
